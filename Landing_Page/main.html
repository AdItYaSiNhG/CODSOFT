<h1>                    Some dope quote on hope</h1>

 <p>“The way we treat the least of these among us determines whether we are more than savages ourselves. That’s why Jesus’ answer to the man who asked, ‘Who is my neighbor?’ is one of the most challenging, powerful and unforgettable sermons ever preached.” - Coretta Scott King</p>

 <p>“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.” - Marianne Williamson</p>

 <p>“One of the things I like most about what people are starting to say is, ‘If I were here, I’d do it.’ If I were here, I’d do it. I think it’s going to change a lot. Because when we are with our fellow human beings and we have compassion and love for them, then that changes us and the way we view things.” - Barack Obama</p>

 <p>“What if, just what if, we began to redefine the nature of community so that, instead of focusing on the presence of evil, it was defined by the presence of good. Instead of dividing our community into winners and losers, what if we simply accepted the idea that everyone in it has a story and that we can be supportive of each other on our journeys?” - Yann Martel</p>

 <p>“Don't be afraid to go after what you want. It's your life. Get up and pursue your passions, dreams, and goals. Do what makes you happy and inspires you, and always surround yourself with positivity and optimism. Your attitude and approach towards life determine the kind of success you will achieve. You are your biggest competitor. You want to win that game against yourself, and it's totally possible.” - Lisa Marie Williams</p>
